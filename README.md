# 🔍 Age & Identity Verification System (Proof of Concept)

This web-based system simulates government ID verification by extracting age and photo from a sample Aadhar card, comparing it to a live selfie, and determining if the person is above a certain age threshold (e.g., 18+). It uses OCR and facial recognition techniques to demonstrate the concept.

## 📌 Problem Statement

### Title:
**Build an Age & Identity Verification System Using Simulated Government ID Cards**

### Objective:
Design a system that can:
1. Extract **Date of Birth (DOB)** and **photo** from a simulated identity document (currently Aadhar).
2. Capture a **live selfie** via the browser.
3. Determine whether:
   - The selfie and ID photo belong to the same individual.
   - The person meets a minimum age requirement (e.g., 18+).

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

- **OCR**: Tesseract (via Python) for extracting DOB and text from Aadhar image.
- **Face Matching**: OpenCV  used to compare ID photo and selfie.
- **Frontend**: React (located in `/frontend/zynga_frontend`) for document upload and selfie capture.
- **Backend**: Node.js & Express (`/backend`) for API handling and result serving.
- **Python Backend**: Flask app (`/python_backend`) to run OCR and facial comparison logic.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Upload simulated Aadhar card (image or PDF)
- ✅ Extract photo and DOB using OCR
- ✅ Capture selfie using webcam
- ✅ Compare ID photo with selfie using facial embeddings
- ✅ Age verification (e.g., 18+)
- ✅ Confidence score display (e.g., 87% match)
- ✅ Feedback for blurry/poor lighting images (basic)

## 💡 Bonus Capabilities

- 🌐 Multi-language support for OCR (future enhancement)
- 📊 Displays numerical verification score
- 💬 Alerts for poor image quality or lighting conditions

troubleshooting:
  - tip: Ensure ports 5173, 5000, and 4000 are available.
  - tip: Make sure C++ build Tools is installed and in PATH.
  - tip: Use virtualenv if pip install fails:
      command: |
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt

notes:
  - This is a proof-of-concept. Do not use with real personal data.
  - No UIDAI or real government APIs are involved.
  - Use only simulated/fake Aadhar cards for testing.
